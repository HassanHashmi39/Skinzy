Project Title: 
Skinzy – AI-Powered Skin Care and Wellness App

Brief Description: 
Skinzy is a mobile-first AI-powered skincare application that provides personalized skincare routines based on facial scanning, weather integration, and lifestyle queries. It is tailored for users in Pakistan, where climate, pollution, and misinformation affect skin health. The app analyzes the user's skin type and concerns (e.g., acne, dryness), recommends organic and local products, and tracks skincare progress through notifications and user engagement tools like community forums.

Problem: 
In Pakistan, many people suffer from skin-related issues due to weather extremes, pollution, and a lack of awareness. Most skincare apps are expensive, non-localized, or focus on Western markets. There is no smart, accessible, and affordable mobile application that offers personalized skincare analysis and product recommendations tailored to the local population.


Related Work:
Some popular skincare platforms, such as YouCam and SkinVision, utilize AI; however, they often lack regional support and affordability. No major application focuses on organic, locally available skincare tailored to Pakistani climates.

Proposed Methodology:
Skinzy will be developed using Flutter or React Native for the frontend, and Node.js or Firebase for the backend. AI tools like TensorFlow Lite or Google ML Kit will be used for facial analysis. The system will:
	Analyze skin using AI
	Ask lifestyle questions for better accuracy
	Integrate local weather data
	Recommend daily skincare routines
	Suggest affordable, organic Pakistani products
	Allow tracking and community interaction

Expected Results:
	Personalized skin diagnosis and routine
	Improved skincare habits and product usage
	High user engagement via trackers and forums
	Positive user reviews and feedback for accuracy and affordability

Conclusion:
Skinzy bridges the gap between conventional skincare and smart technology. It empowers users with personalized, natural, and affordable solutions while addressing regional challenges like weather and pollution. It has strong potential for both societal impact and commercial viability.
